## Simulated Annealing for Travelling Salesman Problem

This repository contains code for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Simulated Annealing (SA). The TSP is a well-known NP-hard problem that seeks to find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle (a path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city) among a set of cities with pairwise distances.

Simulated Annealing is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the annealing process in metallurgy. The algorithm starts with a high "temperature" and gradually decreases it over time, allowing for "bad" moves in the beginning but gradually restricting the search to the "good" ones as the temperature cools down. SA has been shown to be an effective method for solving the TSP, especially for large instances of the problem.
