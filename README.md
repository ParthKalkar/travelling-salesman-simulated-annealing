# Simulated Annealing for Travelling Salesman Problem

This repository contains code for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Simulated Annealing (SA). The TSP is a well-known NP-hard problem that seeks to find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle (a path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city) among a set of cities with pairwise distances.

Simulated Annealing is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the annealing process in metallurgy. The algorithm starts with a high "temperature" and gradually decreases it over time, allowing for "bad" moves in the beginning but gradually restricting the search to the "good" ones as the temperature cools down. SA has been shown to be an effective method for solving the TSP, especially for large instances of the problem.

## Usage
The code is written in Python 3 and requires the following dependencies: numpy, matplotlib. To use the code, simply run the `code.ipynb` file with the desired parameters. The script will generate a random instance of the TSP with a given number of cities (default 30), solve it using SA with a specified cooling rate (default 0.99), and plot the distance vs temperature curve for three different cooling rates (fast, medium, slow). The final path and distance will also be printed to the console.

## Dataset
For the data, we have used a dataset of Russian cities that contains their GPS location (longitude and latitude) and their population. The dataset is available
at https://github.com/hflabs/city. To simplify the task we only take the top 30 cities in terms of population.

## Comparing Cooling Factors
The graph shows the variation of the distance from the optimal solution over iterations at different cooling schedules with different cooling rates (alpha). The x-axis represents the iteration number, while the y-axis represents the distance from the optimal solution. The graph shows that the fast cooling schedule (alpha=0.66) converges the fastest, while the slow cooling schedule (alpha=0.99) converges the slowest. The medium cooling schedule (alpha=0.88) shows intermediate performance.

Therefore, we can conclude that the cooling rate affects the convergence rate of simulated annealing, with a higher cooling rate leading to faster convergence but a higher chance of getting stuck in a local minimum, while a lower cooling rate leads to slower convergence but a lower chance of getting stuck in a local minimum.
